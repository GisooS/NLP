# NLP
This is my NLP course project.
1. "Author profiling" --> Extracting some features and see if the artist's group into some genre (7 or so) clusters based on these features. The features would be obtained through sentiment analysis, mood analysis, topic modeling and then the different artists will be clustered according to genre (defined by certain characteristics). The correctness of our genre clustering will then be easily checkable.
2. Matching artists based on how similar their styles are, then check on Spotify to see how artists are associated and proposed together.
3. Bonus Part: trying to generate text based on the artist features we found.
